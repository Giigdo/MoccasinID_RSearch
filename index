 <h1>What this page is for</h1>
    <p>This page is an experimental link to an LLM (Large Language Model - AI) that accesses a repository of notes and quotes from Indigenous authors. It exists as a preliminary examination of the question, "what would Indigenous AI be like". The llama below is a link to the repository. Click on it to start a conversation with the archive, </p>
    <p>This is not a permanent page as it is currently an experiment. If you come back in the future you may find it expanded or indeed no longer operating. Please use carefully and understand that you still need to do research, talk with Indigenous people and fully consider how you are using the information provided. It is by no means infallible, or comprehensive. If you use any information, cite the sources from the archive not the archive. Miigwech</p>
